# Avalanche_Effect_Test
The avalanche effect is an important factor in stating the cryptographic algorithm quality. If a single byte (or 1 bit) is changed in plaintext at the moment of encryption, the output changes significantly. To measure the quality of block ciphers, a small change in either the key or the plaintextâ€”should present a drastic change in the ciphertext.
